# SonarSense: Rock vs Mine Detection

![RvsM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f374b373-a511-46b9-b89f-1fddd2ba5e20) 

This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately distinguishing between rocks and mines using sonar data collected by submarines. By employing advanced techniques in machine learning and data analysis, we aim to create a reliable and efficient system for detecting and classifying underwater objects.

## Dataset: 
The dataset used in this project consists of sonar signals collected by submarines. These signals are represented as numerical arrays, each containing 60 values. Each value in the array represents the intensity of the sonar signal at a specific angle.

## Pre-processing: 
It primarily involves data cleaning and normalization technique.

## Model Development: 
There is a variety of machine learning models. The predictive models developed were Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, as well as Decision Trees.

## Evaluation: 
Models have been validated based on the chosen metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Outcome: 

Accuracy on training data : 0.8342245989304813

Accuracy on test data : 0.7619047619047619
