# Rock Vs Mine Prediction

![RvsM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f374b373-a511-46b9-b89f-1fddd2ba5e20) 


This is a Machine Learning Project that categorizes objects into rocks or mines using the data from reflected sonar signals. It makes use of features based on datasets, derived f
rom sonar signals, bounced from various surfaces. The most important elements in it are as follows:

## Dataset: 
Features refer to the properties of the sonar signal whereas the target variable refers to a rock or mine.

## Pre-processing: 
It primarily involves data cleaning and normalization technique.

## Model Development: 
There is a variety of machine learning models. The predictive models developed were Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, as well as Decision Trees.

## Evaluation: 
Models have been validated based on the chosen metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Accuracy on training data : 0.8342245989304813

Accuracy on test data : 0.7619047619047619

## Outcome: 
The project is to demonstrate application of ML techniques in analyzing sonar data effectively between rocks and mines.

This project is simply one excellent example of leveraging machine learning for practical classification problems which have real-world implication.
